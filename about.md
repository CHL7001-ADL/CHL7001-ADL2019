	<p class="intro">space2vec is a blog to help document the interserction of machine learning and astronomy.</p>
	<p>We're asking "can machine learning, and specifically modern deep learning techniques, help the astronomy world?". We're aiming to be transparent as possible about the learning curves, as well as documenting if, or if not, deep learning can be useful to astronomers.</p>
	<p>space2vec is run by Cole Jackes, Brendan Ross, Cole Clifford, and Pippin Lee––with support from <a href="http://deeplearni.ng" target="_blank">DeepLearni.ng</a>.</p>
